\section{Deadlock prevention}
\subsection{Determine which lock request will be granted, blocked or aborted by the lock manager 1 (LM1)}

\subsection{Give te wait-for graph for the lock request in the table (Figur \ref{fig:Lm1TableDeadlock}). Give one reason why LM1 Results in a deadlock }

Since the graph (Figur \ref{fig:waitForGraphForLM1DeadLock}) contains a cycle in such a way that T1, T2, T3 is waiting for each other, this results in a deadlock

\subsection{Deadlock prevention with LM2} \label{deadlockLM2section}
Please note that we have created a table (Figur \ref{fig:Lm123TableDeadlockPrevention}) that illustrates the task of section \ref{deadlockLM2section} and section \ref{deadlockLM3section}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{LM2 with Wait-Die policy.}}
	\item S(D) on T1 is granted.
	\item X(B) on T3 is granted
	\item S(A) on T1 is granted
	\item S(C) on T2 is granted
	\item X(C) on T1 is blocked
	\item X(B) on T2 is blocked
	\item X(A) on T3 is aborted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deadlock prevention with LM3} \label{deadlockLM3section}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{LM2 with Wound-wait policy.}}
	\item S(D) on T1 is granted.
	\item X(B) on T3 is granted
	\item S(A) on T1 is granted
	\item S(C) on T2 is granted
	\item Abort S(C) on T2
	\item Abort X(B) on T3
	\item X(A) on T3 is blocked
\end{itemize}
